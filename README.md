# 👩🏻‍💻 I practice R!

## A collection of R Notebooks with mini-projects and challenge questions for continued learning and skill maintenance using R.

I initially learned R in a laboratory research setting, with a primary emphasis on generating graphs using *ggplot2* and other data visualization packages.  I created this repository to maintain and improve my fluency in R for all aspects of the data analysis pipeline, ranging from data manipulation, to exploration, to visualization.  In addition to practicing base R, I aimed to gain mastery over the following *tidyverse* core packages:

* dplyr
* stringr
* ggplot2

The mini-projects and challenges below chronicle my ongoing R practice:
